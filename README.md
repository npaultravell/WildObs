This project aims to transform Australian vertebrate research by producing a digital Wildlife Observatory that assimilates currently siloed camera trap data into a user-friendly continental database. Cameras are widely used to study and monitor threatened and invasive vertebrates, but produce Big Data that are difficult to store, process, and analyse. Therefore, significant data are ‘lost’ in the system.

The Wildlife Observatory of Australia expects to overcome these key issues, enabling unprecedented knowledge of wildlife distributions and population trends. This should produce a step-change in the timeliness, scale, and depth of evidence available to managers and researchers as they respond to pests, bushfires, floods and climate change.

# What we do

_WildObs will standardise camera surveys, aid image processing, and make camera datasets widely usable for myriad industry and government reporting goals to stimulate research._

>“If our mission is to improve conservation efforts, WildObs can provide the infrastructure to answer hundreds of research questions. WildObs can deliver stronger evidence to influence policies and management decisions and reduce redundancy in expensive sampling efforts. However, an observatory of this type requires us as researchers and land managers to put national interests ahead of our own, and put aside the traditional paradigm of data ownership: our data and technology must be open and freely available for everyone ”.

Enable robust wildlife monitoring and measuring of conservation impact, including applications for species threat assessment, National Recovery plans and contribution to international agreements
Drive new science in long-term environmental change and evaluation of management outcomes for biodiversity
Provide timely evidence of ecosystem function and triggers for preventative and responsive action

# Who we are

TERN has been supporting wildlife monitoring experts in the launch of WildObs, Australia’s wildlife observatory. 
WildObs will standardise the collection and processing of data sourced using camera traps, then collate, curate and share the database for research.
