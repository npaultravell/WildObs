# Who we are

TERN has been supporting wildlife monitoring experts in the launch of WildObs, Australia’s wildlife observatory. 
WildObs will standardise the collection and processing of data sourced using camera traps, then collate, curate and share the database for research.

# What we do

_WildObs will standardise camera surveys, aid image processing, and make camera datasets widely usable for myriad industry and government reporting goals to stimulate research._

<sub>“If our mission is to improve conservation efforts, WildObs can provide the infrastructure to answer hundreds of research questions. WildObs can deliver stronger evidence to influence policies and management decisions and reduce redundancy in expensive sampling efforts. However, an observatory of this type requires us as researchers and land managers to put national interests ahead of our own, and put aside the traditional paradigm of data ownership: our data and technology must be open and freely available for everyone ”. </sub>
